## Tableau Public

Tableau Public allows is used to create visualizations that are easy to read and understand. Everything that is worked on with Tableau Public occurs on the local computer.

## Tableau Server

Tableau Server is used to privately share the visualizations with others. You can create your visualizations locally in Tableau Public and then you can upload your visualizations to Tableau Server.

## Worksheets

Worksheets are the building blocks of our visualizations from which we are able to create dashboards and stories. A worksheet is made up of a single graph or plot, which we will learn how to create later on. Worksheets are customizable, but require almost no actual code.

## Data Visualization Process
When creating Tableau stories, or data visualizations in general, there's a general process that should be followed. You can use this process for most visualizations you'll create.

### Select your questions. 

During this step, you'll consider which results you want to share with your audience. What do they want to see? How can we use that information to make their decision-making process easier?

### Execute independent research. 

You'll need to look at other relevant pieces of information to build a bigger picture. Search other sources to find information that will make your visualization more powerful.
### Craft your Tableau story. 

This is when you create your story, primarily from worksheets and other visuals, with descriptions for each of them.
### Create a written analysis. 

The written analysis is intended to provide additional insight into what we're trying to convey to our audience. This is a good place to add extra detail so that everyone can get on the same page.
