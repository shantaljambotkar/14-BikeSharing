# 14-BikeSharing

## Purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)

For this analysis, we have used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, all the visualiztions are created:

    1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    3. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

The following visualizations are created for:
    1. How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
    2. How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
    3. A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
